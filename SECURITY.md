# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest main branch. Ensure issues reproduce against main.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly.
- Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting if enabled, or open a GitHub Security Advisory draft to the maintainers.
- If private reporting is unavailable, open a minimal issue stating you have a security report and request a private contact channel. Do not include sensitive details publicly.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide remediation updates after triage.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security research that follows this policy and avoids unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or service disruption.
