# Development Task Log

## Previous Task (2025-08-15)

Add small UX improvements and tracking docs without changing architecture:

- Import Workflow feature on workflows list page
- HTTP node configuration: add authentication options (None, Bearer, Basic, API Key)
- Create this document to track TODOs for later

## What changed in this task

- app/(dashboard)/workflows/page.tsx: Added Import button and file JSON ingestion
- components/workflow/node-config-panel.tsx: Added authentication selector and value input for HTTP nodes
- README.md: Updated Managing Workflows with new Import path
- AI_RULES.md: Added note to maintain docs/workflow.md

## Verified

- Typecheck OK (npm run typecheck)
- Build OK (npm run build)

## TODO (deferred)

- Type consistency for dates crossing the network:
  - Consider `string | Date` or client hydration for `WorkflowExecution.startedAt/completedAt`
- Webhook to execution bridge:
  - Trigger workflow execution on POST /api/webhooks/[workflowId] (Implemented via in-memory registry and async execution)
- Error boundaries:
  - Add segment-level `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx` where meaningful
- Persistence backend:
  - Replace LocalStorage with server persistence
- Tests:
  - Add unit tests for import and HTTP auth config changes; integration smoke
  - Add route handler validation tests for `/api/execute-workflow` and webhook route

## Notes

- Logs are not streamed in real-time; they are shown after execution completes.
- Workflows are synced to an in-memory server registry on save and before execution.
